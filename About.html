<h3><strong>WHO WE ARE: CHINATOWN PARTNERSHIP</strong></h3>
    <p>Chinatown Partnership, led by Wellington Chen, was formed in 2006 as new start-up from grounds up to bring residents, business owners and community groups together to rebuild Chinatown following 9/11, and to preserve the neighborhood's unique culture while ensuring its vitality in the future through strategic positioning. With the highly popular Weekend Walks street festive series, Mid-Autumn Festival, One Day in NYC, annual Beautification/Earth Day, East West Parade with Little Italy, Double Valentine’s Day to promote the softer side of Chinatown and the Jewelry District and all the cafes, eateries in the area. Explore Chinatown marketing initiative, Lunar Stages outdoor film screenings, and Taste of Chinatown street events, Chinatown Partnership helps promote the area as a special destination to live, work, and visit.</p>
    <p> In the last 2 plus years Chinatown Partnership has been working with the Chinatown Business Improvement District to engage the community and lead efforts to improve the neighborhood’s physical environment through the Clean Streets initiative, streetscape improvements, enhanced lighting gateways, and wayfinding projects such as the NYC Dept. of Transportation's WalkNYC. During Superstorm Sandy and other storms the two organizations in conjunction with other elected officials use our office as the Superstorm Relief and Coordination Center during the blackout and afterwards with private fundraising, language translation, etc. Just like the 2010 joint workshop with Red Cross folks from all boroughs came in to attend the emergency workshops and to obtain several red Go bags. These are just a small sampling of what type of initiatives and groundwork that have prepared.</p>

    <h3><strong>WHAT WE DO: NEIGHTBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT & DISTRICT PROMOTION</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Improving the Chinatown experience for residents, visitors and business owners.</strong><p>

          <td><h4>Clean Streets</h4>
            <p>Working with the city and neighborhood business owners to <strong>make Chinatown a cleaner, more attractive place to conduct business.</strong></p>
            <p>Through advocacy, and with the cooperation of the NYC Department of Sanitation, Chinatown Partnership  eliminated an AM-morning inspection round to give businesses an opportunity to clean their curbs and avoid excessive fines. </p></td>
          <td><h4>Lighting</h4>
            <p>Developing lighting to transform Chinatown into a warmer and more welcoming place at night.  Pedestrian arms lighting installed on under-lit Canal Street makes the evening safer. <p>
            <p>In response to rising community concerns lobbied by Chinatown Partnership about dimly lit, highly traversed Canal Street, the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) installed 19 supplemental illuminated “pedestrians arms” on lampposts along the busy corridor from Broadway to the Bowery.</p>
            <p>The new radiant extensions have <strong>increased sidewalk illumination and safety and allayed security worries.</strong></p><td>

          <td><h4>Neighborhood Banner Program</h4>
            <p>By sponsoring a banner, your company receives <strong>brand recognition and logo placement on banners (8’ x 3’) on display throughout Chinatown</strong>.</p>
            <p>Banners highlight sponsors' businesses and demonstrate commitment to the neighborhood.  We look forward to the opportunity to work with you and your company.<p></td>
          <td><h4>Sponsor A Basket </h4>
            <p>The Chinatown Partnership has placed 48 new, steel, <strong>green trash cans around Chinatown.</strong> Many local businesses and individuals have joined the effort by sponsoring a litter basket. A plaque on each basket reads "A cleaner Chinatown starts here" in English and "A cleaner Chinatown depends on you and me" in Chinese.</p></td>
        <tr>
          <td><h4>Wayfinding</h4>
            <p>Developing signage, maps, markers and other tools to <strong>help visitors navigate to and through the neighborhood.</strong></p>
            <p>Chinatown has the dubious distinction of being the only Chinatown in North America without a gateway.  City Council set aside $250,000 toward a symbolic entrance to the community.</p></td>
          <td><h4>Parking</h4>
            <p>Addressing a perennial problem in Chinatown.Through advocacy, and with the cooperation of the NYC Department of Transportation, Chinatown Partnership  helped create 180 new parking spaces for non-commercial vehicles along Canal Street after 7:00 p.m. six days a week. The muni-meters accept cash, credit cards and the New York City Parking Card. </p>
            <p>We continue to seek other ways to <strong>increase parking and better utilize available spaces.</strong><p></td>
